# Memory Card Game project for The Odin Project

## Created using create-react-app, in order to practice using hooks

Usage:

- Click on the cards to increase the current score
- Clicking on the same card in the same game will reset the current score
- Highest score is set as the highest game total, 16 is max
- Special cards shown for win/loss.

Created using an overall container game controller that calls cards / a score component. Made use of the useState & useEffect hooks.
